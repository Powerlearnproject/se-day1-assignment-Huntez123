Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software to meet user requirements. The main importance of software engineering in technology industry is that it ensures software systems are secure, reliable and scalable. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Advent of sstructured programming(1960s-1970s)
Structured programming revolutionalized software development by promoting better code, readability, organization and modularity.
Rise of object-oriented programming(1980s-1990s)
OOP introduced concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation, which improved scalability and reusability. They include languages such as; java and c++.
Growth of agile methodologies(2000s-present)
They emphasized on iterative development, adaptability and collaboration.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement analysis - Involves gathering and analyzing the user needs to define the scope of the project and its objectives.
Planning - Defining timelines, resoures, budget and creating a roadmap for the development process.
Design - Developing the technical and architectural designs.
Coding - Writing the actual code based on the design specifications.
Testing - Identifying bugs and defects to ensure software quality.
Deployment - Releasing the software to the end users. 
Maintenance - Proving support and updates to enhance security and performance of the software overtime.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall model is a linear and sequential software development approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It can be applied in banking and government systems.
Agile methodology is a flexible and iterative development approach where software is built in small increments with continuous customer feedback. It can be applied for mobile apps mostly.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer
Writes and maintains codes according to specifications and requirements.
Debugs and optimizes code for performance and security.
Quality assurance engineer
Develops test plans and tests cases for software validation.
Ensures compliance with software quality standards.
Project manager
Oversees project planning, execution and delivery.
Communicates with stakeholders to align goals and expectations.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide an environment for coding, debugging, and testing. Its examples are Eclipse and Visual Studio Code.
VCS track changes in code, thus allowing collaboration and rollback when needed. Its examples are SVN(Subversion) and Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Security and data privacy concerns - Implement use of encryption and secure coding practices.
Debugging and fixing complex issues - Use of debugging tools and peer code reviews to resolve errors efficiently.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit - Tests individual components or functions of the software. Its catches bugs in early development.
Integration - Tests the integration between different modules. Ensures combined components are working together.
System - Tests the entire software application. Validates the software against specified requirements before deployment.
Acceptance - Verifies whether software meets user needs. Ensures customer satisfaction.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the crafting of well-structured prompts to guide AI models in generating relevant, precise and accurate responses. It imporves AI accuracy, reduces ambiguity, enhances efficiency and customizes responces.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague - Tell me about History.
Improved - Provide a summary of Kenya's Fight for Freedom, include its key events in under 300 words. 
This ensures interactions with AI models are more productive and meaningful.
